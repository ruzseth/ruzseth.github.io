This is it, our last week is coming up. As I am also graduating this year with no plans (at least right now) to enter grad school, this may also be my last week of college. 

1. **What did you do this past week?**

	This past week, we looked more into how handler classes, such as the one we created for Project #5, managed pointers to abstact classes. We also looked at static binding, pure virtual methods, and pure virtual destructors.
  
2. **What's in your way?**
	
	I am worried about how well I can do on this upcoming test. I'll need a good score in order to graduate, but I also have a test, program, and paper in my other CS class where I also need good scores in order to graduate. What's in my way is time and understanding the recent concepts we talked about in class.  
  
3. **What will you do next week?**
	
	This week, I will be studying intently for the upcoming test on Thursday and also finishing up papers and studying for tests in other classes. I can hopefully contribute to the google doc Ty Trusty posted and get started on a page of notes for myself too.
  
4. **What is your experience of this class?**
	
	Overall, I really liked this class. It's challenging, but is helpful to get you used to the workflow of a software engineering project. And I mentioned this before, but I also like how we are able to incorporate the OOP principles we learn about in class to our projects. Downing is a good professor because I feel free to ask questions in class and on Piazza too. Class if fun and I enjoy going to it. I would try to come to every class even if we didn't have quizzes. 
	
**Tip-of-the-Week:**



Have an awesome week!
