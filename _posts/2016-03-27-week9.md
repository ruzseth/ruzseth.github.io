It was quite a busy week this past week. Happy Easter everyone!

1. What did you do this past week?

	This past week [IBDB.ME](http://ibdb.me/) came out of production and onto the world wide web! It was quite an exciting week. This is my second website that has gone online. The first being an hackathon project from last year. I was definitely more involved in this project than I was in the hackathon last year when I was first introduced to web development. My responsibilities were front-end and documentation, but I got to learn about back-end and hosting along the way through my teammates. I definitely have more respect for the web designers out there. It's not as easy as it looks. I learned how to navigate bootstrap and how to better communicate with the team. Slack was a great tool.

2. What's in your way?

	I don't think I have any identifiable obstacles right now, but I do realize I need to start doing better on the daily quizzes by delving deeper into the concepts we talk about in the previous class. 

3. What will you do next week?

	This next week I anticipate starting on the next iteration of IBDB.ME with my team. I will be configuring my local machine to work with flask so that I may update design changes for our website without having to push it up to the cluster just to see how it looks each time. I will also be volunteering this week at REZ week. It is a week-long celebration of Jesus's resurrection at Gregory Plaza with nightly talks and live music. There will also be $1 lunches and free coffee, hot cocoa, and tea 24/7. So if you're up late at the lab, come stop by!

Tip of the week: 

For our project, we found these great stock photo resources, free for personal, and even commercial use, if you give credit. I will definitely be using these for future projects myself. Check them out and let me know if you've found some great resources too.
