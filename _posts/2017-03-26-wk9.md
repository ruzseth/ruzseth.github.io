It's Week 9 already! We're in the last stretch!

1. **What did you do this past week?**

	This past week, my focus was on Project #4. This time, I was able to find a partner and work on the project together. It was hard to meet up with my schedule, but thankfully, my partner was also available when I was. Overall, I think it was a better learning experience working on the project with a partner than by myself. I was able to ask questions and discovered new ways of doing things that I would not have thought of.    
  
2. **What's in your way?**
	
	I don't think I have anything in my way right now.
    
3. **What will you do next week?**

	This next week, I will be looking for a partner for the next project and looking ahead to understand how we could go about creating an efficient solution.
    
4. **What is your experience of this class?**

	My experience of the class remains the same. I enjoy the projects, but acknowledge that they are challenging and require time commitment. 
	 
**Tip-of-the-Week:**

Honestly, I am running out of tips so I've been doing research trying to find new tips. While doing research, I found this Quora question asking [How can I stay healthy as a software engineer?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-stay-healthy-as-a-software-engineer). Many of us will be going into the workforce as a software engineer (I think) and I realize I myself have never thought about this question. Reading the answers, here is the list of the most common advice given:
  - Be active, at best 1-1.5hrs of activity. 
  - Don't eat too much. Often, a single serving is actually too much for one person, so just eat until you're not hungry anymore
  - Get enough sleep.
  - Stay away from sugary drinks.
  - Find a company that will help you with your health goals.
  - Sit properly.
While most of these tips are common sense and are for non-software engineers too, it was interesting to see this question asked. What do you think of these tips? Do you have any to add?

Good luck on the project! Stay healthy!
