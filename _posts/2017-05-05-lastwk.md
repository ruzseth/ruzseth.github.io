My experience of Downing's CS 371p OOP class: 
  
  Overall, I really liked this class. It's challenging, but is helpful to get you used to the workflow of a software engineering project. This class is also helpful to learn how to code more efficiently. I realized how much time I had been wasting coding things over and over again. I mentioned this before, but I also like how we are able to incorporate the OOP principles we learn about in class to our projects. Downing is a good professor because I feel free to ask questions in class and on Piazza too. Class if fun and I enjoyed going to it. Just makes sure to study the previous class notes beforehand to do better on the quizzes. And do the projects with partners!
