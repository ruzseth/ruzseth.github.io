My experience of Downing's CS 371p OOP class: 
  
  Overall, I really liked this class. It's challenging, but is helpful to get you used to the workflow of a software engineering project. And I mentioned this before, but I also like how we are able to incorporate the OOP principles we learn about in class to our projects. Downing is a good professor because I feel free to ask questions in class and on Piazza too. Class if fun and I enjoy going to it. I would try to come to every class even if we didn't have quizzes.
