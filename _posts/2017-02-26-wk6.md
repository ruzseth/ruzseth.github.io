**Tip-of-the-Week:**
	My freshman year, I visited a learning specialist here at UT because I was struggling in Calculus. He introduced me to a way of quizzing myself as I studied for a test that really helped me not be overwhelmed by the volume of things I needed to study. You'll need notecards for this. For each term or concept, come up with a question or get with a partner or a group and come up with questions. Don't write the answers on the other side, but just write a hint or a reference point in the book, readings, or lecture notes you can turn back to. Then, in the days leading up to the test, take a few notecards at a time and go through them in your free time. Ths may while walking to class or before going to bed, just whenever you have time. This helps to chunk the material and mixes the topics up so your brain is used to encountering the topics in a different order from the review.
  
  
Hope this helps you! Good luck on the test!
