It's week 12! Another step closer to graduation for a lot of us!

1. **What did you do this past week?**

	This past week, we looked at inheritance through the Shape class example and its relationship to the class Circle. We also went over Project #5. My partner and I started earliers in the week and have been able to get pretty far along. 
  
2. **What's in your way?**
	
	Right now, I would like a better understanding of how handler classes work. I have a vague idea from working on it in Project #5, but I think I'd like another application. I think understanding handlers would help me a lot with understanding how to approach the transformation from Fredkin cell to a Conway cell.
  
3. **What will you do next week?**
	
	This week, I look forward to finishing the Life Project. 
  
4. **What is your experience of this class?**
	
	I really liked the projects we worked on this semester. 
	
**Tip-of-the-Week:**

Have a great week!
