It's the eleventh week!

1. What did you do this past week?

	This week, my group and I finished up the second iteration of our team's website, [IBDB.ME](http://ibdb.me/). In class we learned about mysql, its common statements and various joins. 
  
2. What's in your way?

	I have the flu. I can't breathe and I've missed two days of school so far because I've been running a fever. I need to catch up with the classes I've missed in addition to SWE. Also, I'm still not doing well on the quizzes. I think it's because I'm sometimes not sure what to study for ahead of time and I have other assignments that I usually focus on instead of studying for the quizzes. 

3. What will you do next week?
 
	This upcoming week, I will be using the regex sites recommended on Piazza by my fellow students to learn regex. I will be going through [Regex Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com/) and [Regex Golf](http://regex.alf.nu/). I need to get started reviewing materials for the next test as well, so I'll start compiling a list of topics to study and readings to summarize and begin putting everything down on a sheet of paper.

Tip of the week:

  For those of us who need more practice with the mysql commands and the different joins were learned this week, check out [MySQLTutorial](http://www.mysqltutorial.org/basic-mysql-tutorial.aspx). This site helps you set up a basic database for you to play around with and guides you through basic SQL statements. 

Have a great week!
